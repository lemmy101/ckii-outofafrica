          OUT OF AFRICA - A Crusader Kings II World Generator

Out of Africa generates, from scratch, a completely new history of humanity
from its first exodus from Africa, as a new mod to be playable in CK2.

A random culture and pagan religion is formed, using all the parameters
available for religions and cultures in CK2, as well as forming a unique
language used to name characters, provinces, kingdoms, gods, religions.

These cultures will then spread throughout europe, mutating and changing as
they spread, words and language, religions, ethnicity, cultural ideals, laws,
looting, river sailing, incest, religious heads, holy sites, wives, concubines
and everything, all morphing, mutating and branching off as humans spread
through time and land, and form a completely unique world with absolutely none
of the vanilla cultures, religions, provinces, de-jure duchies or anything
found in the base game.

Absolutely everything about the history of the world (except the map data
itself) is unique.

Note that this depends on .NET 4.5. It is tested to work using mono.
