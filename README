                OUT OF AFRICA - A Crusader Kings II World Generator

Introducing the 'Out of Africa' Crusader Kings 2 Alternate History Generator
tool!

WARNING: This is a very early alpha and is for testing purposes only. Don't
expect results that will allow for a fun complete game at this stage as there
are plenty of events and features missing!

Basically it will generate, from scratch, a completely new history of humanity
from its first exodus from Africa as a new mod to be playable in CKII. A random
culture and pagan religion is formed (as in completely random, using all the
parameters available for religions and cultures in CKII, as well as forming a
unique language used to name characters, provinces, kingdoms, gods, religions.
These cultures will then spread throughout europe, mutating and changing as
they spread, words and language, religions, ethnicity, cultural ideals, laws,
looting, river sailing, incest, religious heads, holy sites, wives, concubines
and everything, all morphing, mutating and branching off as humans spread
through time and land, and form a completely unique world with absolutely none
of the vanilla cultures, religions, provinces, de-jure duchies or anything found
in the base game. Absolutely everything about the history of the world except
the map data itself is unique.
